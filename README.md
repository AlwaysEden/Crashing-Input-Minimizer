#CIMIN(Crash Input minimizer)

This program is to minimize crash input. Minimizing crash input is helpful for programmers because they check a smaller code, not all codes.
To execute this program, you can put ./cimin -i [crash input file] -m "[Error string]" -o [file to store output] [target program].
However, I couldn't develop the function.
